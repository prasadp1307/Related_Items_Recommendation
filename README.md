# Related_Items_Recommendation

A technique for identifying common patterns, correlations, linkages, and causal structures from data sets stored in various databases, including relational databases, transactional databases, and other forms of data repositories, is known as association rule mining. Association rule mining allows for the finding of interesting connections and linkages among large sets of data items. This rule specifies how frequently a specific item appears in a transaction. A good example is Market Based Analysis. Association rules are critical in data mining for analyzing and forecasting consumer behavior. Customer analytics, market basket analysis, product clustering, catalogue design, and shop layout are all examples of where they're employed. To create machine learning programs, programmers use association rules.
